# OSU CSE 2221 – Software I: Software Components (Java)

📘 **OSU CSE Components API (official reference)**  
https://cse22x1.engineering.osu.edu/common/doc/

This repository contains my complete workspace for **CSE 2221 (Software I: Software Components)** at **The Ohio State University**.  
The course focuses on foundational Java programming, abstraction, testing, recursion, and the **OSU Components** design framework.

All projects were implemented using:
- the OSU **Java Components** library  
- Eclipse  
- JUnit testing

---

## 📁 Included Projects

The workspace includes multiple course labs and assignments such as:

- **Glossary** – Build an HTML glossary generator using maps, sets, and sorting  
- **AppendUndoGUI** – Implement a GUI with append/undo functionality using queues  
- **Hailstone** – Compute and analyze hailstone sequences  
- **HomePage** – Generate a simple HTML homepage  
- **ArraysAndReferences** – Intro labs covering arrays and reference semantics  
- **HelloWorld / HelloJack** – intro examples  
- **Chill** – Simple components practice  
- **ProjectTemplate** – Base template using OSU Components  
- (Plus other starter labs and exercises)

Each project typically includes:
- `src/` — Java source code  
- `test/` — JUnit tests  
- `data/` — sample input/output when needed
